#
Put other files after the "#" if you don't want to plot them


This text file contains a list of two other text files: Lakes_Map and Seismicity_All (any files in the list must be on your MATLAB path)

This first file contains longitude and latitude coordinates for the outline of some lakes in the study area. These will be plotted as a black
line as shown by the line specifier (-k) with a line width of 1, a fill color of blue, and facealpha (transparency) of 0.5.

The second file contains longitude, latitude and elevation coordinates for earthquake epicenters in the study area. These will be plotted as blue
dots as shown by the color and marker specifier (b.) with a marker size of 4.

After the list, there is a # and the file will not be read after this point, so you can add comments or whatever you want after that point.

# each file must contain only lines, markers, or filled polygons
# polygons should start and end at the same point
# the plotting style will be the same for every object in a particular file

# Valid entries:

for Markers:
filename, type
filename, type, color+marker, markersize

for Lines:
filename, type
filename, type, linestyle+color, linewidth
filename, type, linestyle+color+marker, linewidth, markersize

for Fills:
filename, type
filename, type, linestyle+color, linewidth, facecolor, facealpha
