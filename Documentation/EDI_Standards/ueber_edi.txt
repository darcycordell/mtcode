Summary

In December, 1987, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) adopted a 
standard format for the interchange of magnetotelluric (MT) and 
electromagnetic array profiling (EMAP) data. The standard format was 
developed over a period of two years and incorporated input from a variety 
of audiences who deal with MT and EMAP data including oil company 
representatives, contractors, and consultants. The complete, published 
description of the format is available from SEG.

This presentation briefly summarizes some of the important aspects of the 
standard. It includes brief discussions of the history, purpose, and scope 
of the standard, the format of an interchange file, and the representation 
of spatial relations. Finally, it makes recommendations regarding the 
application of the format.

Background

In early 1986, representatives from some of the major users of 
magnetotelluric (MT) and electromagnetic array profiling (EMAP) data formed 
an ad hoc committee to investigate a standard for the interchange of MT and 
EMAP data. By June, 1986, the committee produced a first draft describing an 
industry-wide standard for the interchange of MT and EMAP data. Over the 
course of the next 16 months, the standard was circulated to a variety of 
audiences for review and revision. A draft was presented to the SEG 
Standards Committee in November, 1986. In August, 1987, a meeting of the ad 
hoc committee was held which approved a final draft and forwarded it to the 
SEG Standards Committee. The standard was adopted by the SEG Executive 
Committee on December 14, 1987. Copies of the standard may be obtained from 
SEG.

A data file which conforms to the standard for the interchange of MT, EMAP, 
or similar electrical geophysical data is referred to here as an Electrical 
Data Interchange (EDI) file.

Purpose and Scope of the Standard

The standard is intended to provide a complete, orthogonal, unambiguous 
description of a data set. The standard has been designed such that the data 
in an EDI file can be interpreted without referencing a base map or other 
field documents. Within an EDI file, concepts specific to a particular 
acquisition system do not drive the organization of the data.

Although the format is rigorously specified, it has been designed to be 
flexible and extensible. The inclusion of complete spatial information is 
inherent in the standard. The format described by the standard was designed 
for the interchange and archival of data. It is not intended for use as a 
working format.

The standard defines the physical format and media on which EDI files may 
reside. Although the only media currently specified by the standard is 
magnetic tape, the use of non-standard media is discussed within the 
standard.

The standard provides a consistent set of definitions for geophysical 
quantities and units. These include units, phase conventions, and similar 
concepts. It supports a variety of processing alternatives and includes 
escape mechanisms to handle experimental and non-standard data.

The standard specifies the syntax and semantics for an EDI file with the 
same precision that a computer language is specified by its reference 
manual. In fact, the format for an EDI file is analogous to a source code 
file for a computer program. A program which reads EDI files and converts 
the data into a usable form is analogous to a compiler.

General Characteristics of Electrical Data Interchange (EDI) Files

EDI files are ASCII text files. Although such a file is made up of a series 
of data records, the file is considered to be a character stream. For 
handling special cases with large amounts of data, the standard makes 
provisions for parallel binary data files which are referenced by the EDI 
file. However, these are the exception rather than the rule and will not be 
discussed here.

Comments may be embedded within EDI files, allowing special annotations to 
be included. Additionally, there is a special provision for a section of 
free-form text to be included with each file. This section serves a special 
purpose, embedding a description of the system dependent parameters related 
to the acquisition and processing of a particular data set.

Building Blocks for EDI Files

EDI files are constructed from Data Blocks (or sometimes simply, Blocks). A 
data block consists of a keyword, optionally followed by one or more 
options, optionally followed by a data set.

All data blocks begin with a keyword. A keyword always begins with the 
character >. Examples of keywords are >HEAD, >SPECTRA, >FREQ, and >ZXXR. 
Over one hundred keywords are defined for EDI files. An option has two 
parts: an option name, and an option argument, separated by an equal sign 
(=). Examples of options are:

DATAID=SITE1,
ACQDATE=01/31/88,
ROTATE=NORTH,
REFLAT=+30:50:40.3,   and
GAIN=1.25

Normally, a data set consists of two slash characters //, followed by a 
number which gives the number of data values, followed by the actual data 
values. Alternatively, a data set may be represented by special characters 
which indicate that the actual data is to be read from a parallel binary 
data file.

Syntactically, an EDI file is a sequence of data blocks. Every data block 
exactly fits the description above. The one exception to this rule is the 
free-form text which immediately follows the >INFO block.

Organizing the Data Blocks

Within an EDI file, sequences of data blocks may be grouped into sections. 
Each section begins with a special data block whose keyword begins with the 
two characters >=. These special data blocks are analogous to the FORTRAN 
statements SUBROUTINE and FUNCTION which separate a FORTRAN program into 
contexts.

Just as there are rules for the order of statements in a FORTRAN program, 
there are rules for the ordering of blocks within an EDI file. All files 
begin with a >HEAD block, an >INFO block and a >=DEFINEMEAS section. 
Following this are one or more data sections. Types of data sections include 
>=MTSECT sections, >=EMAPSECT sections, and >=SPECTRASECT sections. 
Following all of the data sections is an >END block.

Measurements and Spatial Relations

Each EDI file defines a set of measurements. All of the data within the file 
is referenced back to that set of measurements. Each measurement corresponds 
to a particular channel (E-field dipole or H-field sensor) and to a 
particular run. A measurement is defined in terms of sensor locations and 
other parameters.

All sensor locations within an EDI file are expressed as relative offsets 
from a single reference point.

Programs to Read and Write EDI Files

It has been pointed out repeatedly that EDI files are analogous to source 
code files. That analogy may be extended to programs for reading them. The 
same techniques used for writing compilers can be applied to developing 
programs for reading EDI files. Formal specification mechanisms such as 
Backus-Naur form for syntactic specification can be used to precisely 
specify the syntax for an EDI file.

Techniques are available which can take such formal specifications and 
generate tables which succinctly describe the data format. Through the use 
of unambiguous specifications, a program can verify an EDI file as 
syntactically and semantically correct, just as a compiler verifies the 
correctness of a source code file. Additionally, the same tables can be used 
to write data which is guaranteed to be in the standard format.

A FORTRAN 77 program for reading and writing data EDI files was developed in 
parallel with the formulation of the standard. Not only did this assure that 
the published standard was implementable, it pointed out a number of 
inconsistencies which were addressed prior to the final version.

Comments and Recommendations

The EDI format allows a great deal of flexibility in the organization and 
presentation of data, just as within a programming language there are many 
ways to do the same task. The following recommendations may provide some 
guidance:

Expressing all spatial locations for measurements relative to a common 
reference location allows the interpreter to relate a number of sites or 
surveys to one another. Within the limits of projection accuracy, surveys 
should attempt to use a common reference location.

Channel identifiers should be chosen so as to be meaningful, such as 
(10*SiteNumber)+C, where C=1 for Hx, 2 for Hy, 3 for Hz, 4 for Ex, and 5 for 
Ey. Run identifiers should be assigned sequentially.

For all but very large MT surveys, it is recommended that data for all sites 
be put into a single EDI file. This guarantees a common reference location. 
Within the file, an >=MTSECT section should be included for each site. 
Within each section are data blocks for all of the computed quantities.

If spectra for an MT survey are to be delivered, it is recommended that 
these reside in an EDI file which is separate than that used for the 
computed parameters. However, the reference location and measurement 
definition section should be identical. A separate >SPECTRASECT section 
should be used for each site.

The set of measurements for the section should include all of those for the 
site plus any others which may be used as remote reference pairs. Seven or 
nine measurements would be typical. It is recommended that all spectra be 
rotated to true North.

For EMAP surveys, it is recommended that data for a survey be included 
within a single EDI file. An >=EMAPSECT section will be used for each line. 
Within each section, it is recommended that only the impedances (Z's) be 
included for each dipole. The large data volume of the apparent 
resistivities, phases, and 1-D inversions usually outweigh the time to re-
compute them. Because the volume of EMAP data can become quite large, it may 
be necessary to break the lines within a survey into separate files for 
practical reasons. In such cases, the same reference should be used for all 
files within the limits of projection accuracy. If both raw and spatially 
filtered data are to be delivered, it is recommended that they be written in 
separate EDI files.

Spectra for EMAP surveys should be delivered in an EDI file which is 
separate than that used for the impedances. The reference location and 
measurement definition section would, however, be identical. A >=SPECTRASET 
will be included for each set of simultaneously acquired dipoles and H-field 
measurements.

Specifications for delivery of time series data have been included within 
the standard, but it is recommended that time series data not be included 
with data deliveries unless there are specific reasons for doing so. 
Parallel binary files have been defined within the standard for handling 
very large data sets. They are not recommended for normal use.

Conclusions

In the past, each contractor has supported its own format for data 
interchange. These formats were also subject to change from time to time. As 
a result, many programs were required for reading and writing data. 
Additionally, the content of the data formats was insufficient to 
reconstruct the data without outside information.

The introduction of a standard format will allow both contractors and 
clients to support programs for reading and writing data in a single format. 
Data written in the standard format is guaranteed to be completely and 
unambiguously specified. Because the standard has been thoroughly documented 
and officially adopted by the SEG, data archived in the standard format will 
always be usable in the future.

Additionally, the standard offers new opportunities for processing and 
interpretation. New interpretation workstations are becoming available which 
can take advantage of the spatial relations within a data set.

Most of the MT and EMAP contractors are now able to produce data in the 
standard format. Efforts are also underway to re-format old data to conform 
to the new standard. The success of any standard hinges upon its widespread 
acceptance. A great deal of effort has been put into producing a standard 
which matches the current needs of the industry while retaining the 
flexibility to meet future needs. This standard will, hopefully, be a major 
benefit to MT and EMAP exploration.
